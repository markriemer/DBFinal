select wrote.id, books.title, authors.name FROM wrote JOIN authors ON wrote.author_id = authors.id JOIN books ON wrote.book_id = books.book_id;

customize db.py to change number of authors and publishers.
Increasing authors will slow down the program

to destroy database and reinit with empty tables
mysql -u zippy -p < final_project_dml.sql

to repopulate data
python3.5 db.py awesome_covers.json

OR
mysql -u zippy -p < final_project_ddl.sql
This will restore with all of the harvested data
